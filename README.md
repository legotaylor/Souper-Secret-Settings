# Souper Secret Settings
Re-adds the old super secret settings through the power of soup!

Simply drink a beetroot soup to activate a random souper secret setting, then drink milk or reload resources (F3+T) to clear it

You can stack multiple shaders at once using the GUI, which is bound to `u` by default, and always accessible with `/soup:gui`

### *This mod requires [Luminance](https://modrinth.com/mod/luminance) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)!*

Optifine/Iris [shaderpacks](https://modrinth.com/shaders) are compatible, so you can get some pretty cool looking combinations - personally i found that using [Epoch](https://modrinth.com/shader/epoch) or [Vector](https://modrinth.com/shader/vector) as a base can look really cool

Souper secret settings also expands on vanillas old super secret settings by adding *many* [(list)](SuperSecretSettingsList.md) new ones, have fun eating soup!

New shaders can be added through resourcepacks [(guide)]((https://github.com/mclegoman/luminance/blob/development-1.21/ResourcepackGuide/ResourcepackGuide.md)) - however, you can also edit the parameters of existing shaders (and save your layer of modified shaders!), all within the GUI:

You can send your friends your saved layers with `/soup:layer copy (current|saved)` and `/soup:layer copy load clipboard`

There are commands (which all start with `/soup:`, so they're easy to find) for everything the GUI can do - this is useful for map making with [Client Execution](https://modrinth.com/plugin/client-execution), or any mod that allows you to set keybinds for commands

## Older versions

Older versions (1.21.1 and below) of the mod dont require Luminance, but will get some extra shaders if you do use it. If you are using one of those versions, check out [the old description](https://github.com/Nettakrim/Souper-Secret-Settings/blob/old/README.md). These versions may also require you to manually enable a resourcepack for the custom shaders to show up.
